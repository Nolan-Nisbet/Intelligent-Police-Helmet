# Intelligent-Police-Helmet
This project is aimed to tackle the technological limitations police officers face when they are away from their vehicles or out on patrol. The goal of this project is to design an intelligent safety helmet that will be outfitted with several features that will function both as a means of protecting an officer and providing them with supplemental information not clearly apparent to them through the use of computer vision applications. The brain of the helmet, the Jetson TK1 Developmental Board, receives a live video stream from the helmet mounted camera, where we then plan to implement: facial detection for suspect recognition, calls to Microsoft Oxford APIâ€™s for individual information (age, gender, emotional state), and video storage onto a black box. The information will be presented to the officer via a GUI on a touchscreen heads-up-display unit, which allows for officer input to access the different functions.
